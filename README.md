🎮 Pixel Quest

A creative journey from conception to realization of a 2D game universe using pixel art techniques

📖 Overview
Pixel Quest is an educational project focused on creating a complete 2D game universe using pixel art techniques. This project explores the history of pixel art styles, from 1980s gaming constraints to modern 2D game development, while creating characters, objects, and environments for a medieval fantasy-themed game.
The project includes both practical game asset creation and a slide presentation showcasing the development process.
